i. Packet Capture Using Wireshark
Wireshark is a network packet analyzer used to capture live traffic on a computer network.
● Launch Wireshark and identify active network interfaces such as Ethernet or Wi-
Fi from the home screen.
● Select the interface showing live traffic and click Start Capturing Packets (icon of a 
blue shark fin) or press Ctrl + E to begin capture.
● Wireshark collects frames and displays them in real time as a list in the Packet List 
Pane.
ii. Starting Wireshark
● Open Wireshark via Start Menu or Terminal.
● Choose your network interface card (NIC) that carries internet traffic (for example, Wi-
Fi 3 or eth0).
● Click on Capture → Start, or use the keyboard shortcut Ctrl + E to begin recording 
packets.
● Let it run briefly and then click Capture → Stop to finish.
● Save your capture as .pcap file for further analysis.
iii. Viewing Captured Traffic
The Wireshark main window has three panes for inspecting packets:
1. Packet List Pane – Displays each captured packet with details such as number, time, 
source, destination, protocol, and length.
2. Packet Details Pane – Shows the hierarchical structure of selected packet protocols 
(Ethernet, IP, TCP, HTTP, etc.).
3. Packet Bytes Pane – Displays raw data (in hexadecimal or ASCII) of the selected packet 
for low-level analysis.
Clicking on any packet updates the other panes instantly, providing detail down to field-level 
structure in network headers.
iv. Analysis and Statistics & Filters
Wireshark provides analytical tools and filtering options for traffic examination:
● Display Filters limit visible packets using syntax like ip.addr == 192.168.1.5, http, 
or tcp.port == 80.
● Statistics Menu includes features:
● Protocol Hierarchy: shows proportion of Ethernet, IP, TCP, and application-
layer traffic.
● Conversations: lists communication pairs between devices.
● IO Graphs: visualizes traffic volume over time.
● Follow TCP Stream reconstructs full client-server communication for one session.
● Expert Info highlights retransmissions, delays, or malformed packets.
